# R_for_Data_Science_Solutions

Solutions as I work my way through the [*R for Data Science*](https://www.amazon.com/R-Data-Science-Hadley-Wickham/dp/1491910399/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&qid=1469550189&sr=8-1&keywords=R+for+data+science&linkCode=sl1&tag=devtools-20&linkId=6fe0069f9605cf847ed96c191f4e84dd) book by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund. Available [online](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/).

To check some answers I will also use [Jeffrey Arnold's Solutions](https://jrnold.github.io/r4ds-exercise-solutions/index.html)

Disclaimer: I've written these solutions for myself, so there may be mistakes. I started chapter 1 in a notebook saved on my computer then transferred over to markdown and github. I wanted a space to hold my work for later reference. I may go back and update Ch. 1 questions and answers, but later chapters will be better at showing questions/answers/work.
